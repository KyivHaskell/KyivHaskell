# Kyiv Haskell User Group

The Kyiv Haskell Users Group is for all programmers either interested in or experienced with the Haskell programming language. We want to build a community of Haskell developers in the Kyiv that can share knowledge, projects, and experience.

We are a subpart of [Kievfprog](http://kievfprog.net/) community, which has goal to generally foster and encourage functional programming in Kyiv, in all functinoal languages, all settings, and all industries.

Our current goal is to run Study Groups to get more people involved. Later goal is to add talks, host social hours, code workshops, and a hackathons.
